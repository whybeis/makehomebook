        World Wide Web Consortium 웹표준을 개발하는 민간 국제 컨소시엄이다.

            The organization tries to foster compatibility and agreement among industry members in the adoption of new standards defined by the W3C.
            Incompatible versions of HTML are offered by different vendors, causing inconsistency in how web pages are displayed. The consortium tries
            to get all those vendors
            to implement a set of core principles and components which are chosen by the consortium.

            It was originally intended that CERN host
            the European branch of W3C; however, CERN wished to focus
            on particle physics,
            not information technology.
            In April 1995, the French Institute for Research
            in Computer Science and Automation (INRIA) became the European host
            of W3C, with Keio University Research Institute at SFC (KRIS)
            becoming the Asian host in September 1996.[4] Starting in 1997,
            W3C created regional offices around the world. As of September 2009,
            it had eighteen World Offices covering Australia, the Benelux
            countries (Netherlands, Luxembourg, and Belgium), Brazil, China, Finland,
            Germany, Austria, Greece, Hong Kong, Hungary, India, Israel, Italy,
            South Korea, Morocco, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, and, as of 2016,
            the United Kingdom and Ireland.
